                Purchase $15 worth of VGF tokens for membership and staking purposes. You can receive 10% in Direct
                Referral Rewards and potentially earn up to 20% of the VGF farmed by your referred members. Your daily
                rewards are contingent on your chosen package, and your rank is determined by the volume of your direct
                sales.

                Unlock a world of opportunities! Start your VGFSWAP journey by investing just $15 in VGF tokens for
                membership and staking, depending on your chosen package. This $15 in VGF tokens may be temporarily
                locked for transaction fees and isn't transferable for staking. But here's where it gets exciting: when
                you refer someone who stakes VGF tokens, you'll bask in the glory of 10% Direct Referral Rewards from
                their staked amount. It's like putting your money to work while building your network!
